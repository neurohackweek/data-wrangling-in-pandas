# Data wrangling in pandas

Presented by [Tal Yarkoni](http://github.com/tyarkoni) at The University of Washington eScience Institute's [Neurohackweek 2016](https://neurohackweek.github.io/nhw2016/) course.

All content can be found in [this Jupyter notebook](data-wrangling-in-pandas.ipynb). You can either view the rendered notebook online, or clone/download the notebook to your local machine and run it interactively with Jupyter. Note that at the moment, the notebook contains empty code cells--these are placeholders we'll fill in during the hands-on tutorial.
